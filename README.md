# Electronics_Project_1
This project is a circuit that serves specific requirements.
This project aims to apply the knowledge we gained during this semester in Electronics 1 course. Each task has a direct relationship with a significant division of our syllabus.
We were asked to perform four tasks, each with a certain circuit or component - check the report for more details.
NOTE: the current that passes through the touch sensor is affected by the implementation of varied loads - it could be very low or very high.
